# Machine-Learning-
This a a repository of free starter machine learning python implementations. This is a beginner collection however, I will probably make a more advanced set soon. This repository ranges from learning mean median and mode with numpy to using polynomial regression and plotting scatter plots with matplotlib.
# How to get started
A great way to get started with this code is to just read the files. Start with mean and understand from the start how to do the different functions. This will also get you to know what modules you will be needing as well. In every code file there will be comments do describe what is happening in the file so it is easier to understand.
